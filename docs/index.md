<p>The image below shows a typical website generated by the parish council system. The system has been installed under a newbigginparishcouncil.co.uk url , configured with newbigginparishcouncil.co.uk/manager.html and then launched by referencing newbgginparishcouncil.co.uk.  A selection of helpful slides have been inserted into the carousel and then sections have been configured to hold an "About" document detailing the composition and functions of the council, a Minutes section to hold records of recent meetings of the council and a Policies section.  As will be described later in this document, the selection and specification of the Sections is open-ended.  likewise, there is no limit onthe number of Entries that can be created in each section. Entries are sorted alphabetically but sections can be placed in any desired sequence. Only the first four entries in any given Section are displayed but a button permits the remainder to be revealed, as required .</p>

<p>Configuration and maintenance of a parishcouncil website is carried out using the manager.html file. This is accessed by typing in its url - eg newbigginparishcouncil.com/manager.html. You might find it useful to create a bookmark for this url.

Once the system has logged you in (and please be aware that unattended session will timeout, so be prepared to signin again if requested later) you are presented with a screen such as the one shown below:

There are three elements to the system  - carousel slides, website sections and section entries. The  manager.html provides a mechanism for controlling each element. Additionally, since it's sometimes useful to get the website's view of the information, there's a facility to quickly pull up a snapshot in a popup window. Here's a quick summary of the  three elements:

Carousel slides is a collection of graphic files that can use to give a flavour of your community to the eager public. Each can be displayed with a short caption to announce what it depicts. The initial github system installation includes a pair of typical graphics so the slide carousel will work from the outset

Website sections are used to define the filing structure of your website. Typically, for example you would have section for Minutes and another for Policies. You can have as many sections as you like and, once you have defined them, you can arrange for them to be displayed in any sequence that you choose. The system as installed includes both a Minutes and a Policies section

Website entries define the individual documents refereneced by a section - typically a pdf file containing the minutes for a meeting. Sample Minutes and Policies entries are included in the installation file set.

CAROUSEL Maintenance

Clicking the "Configure Carousel" button reveals a display similar to the one below. This allows yu to change the overall title for the site and to add, delete and update the slides for the carousel. Carousle slide files can be of any graphic format but for artistic and operational effect are probably best standardised to a 16:9 width:height format and a maximum size of .5Mb. "Drag and drop" can be used to alter the order of appearance of the slides - just remember to click the "Reorder" button after you've finished dragging and dropping.

SECTIONS maintenance

Clicking the "Configure Sections" button reveals a screen such as the one below. It is designed to allow you to create new sections and to update and delete existing ones. Again there is a "reorder" button to allow you to change the order in which sections will be displayed by the website. 

The Insert button requires you firstly to declare a short identification tag for the section. This is used internally for file-naming purposes. You also need to declare a display title for the section as it will appear in the website. The remaining fields - section prefix and section type - are used to define the way individual entries for the section will be tabulated in the website. Experience show that for a Parish Council application, there are two types of entry - entries which are essentially related to a Date (eg Minutes) and entries that are just characterised by a simple title. The websites reference to an entry for a Date type section might typically read "Minutes for 2020-07-03". In this case the Section has been defined as "date Type" and the Section prefix has been set to "Minutes for : ". An Entry for a secetion defined as "sundries" might simply read "are map for Newbiggin Village", in which case the sundries section must have been declared as "standard type" with a blank Prefix.

Be aware if that while you can create and rename sections without constraint, the system draws a line at you deleting /every/ section. In this event you will find the system will create a dummy "default" section. If you delete this, it will just create another one, so best rename it as your first section if you're actually just trying to start from scratch with a new set of sections.

ENTRIES maintenance

Once the system is up and running, routine maintenance will just consist of the addition of new Entries and so it is the Entries maintenance screen which provides the initial view of the system. Manager.html remembers the last section you were working on and automatically reutrns to this view on re-entry. If you want to switch to entries-maintenance for a different section, simply select this from the picklist.

For Standard Entry inserts you just need to specify a Title for the entry and select a file for upload. Not that only pdf type files are supported.

For Date Entry inserts, clicking in the title field will reveal a date-picker to allow you to quickly specify the date for the entry in a standard format. For Date Entry inserts you ccan also specify an optionl suffix for each individual entry, so that a Minutes Entry for an AGM might read "Minutes for : 2020-05-06 (AGM)", where the prefix for the section has been specified as "Minutes for : " and the suffix for this particular engtry has been declared as "(AGM)".

GENERAL

DoO be aware that the technical design for the parishcouncil system is extremely simple - deliberately so in order to minimise setup and maintenance complications. In particular there is no database to manage simultaneus operation by numerous updaters. There is no problem with simultaneous retrieval, however, an it is assumed that for a Parish Council system, where, the only updates are likely to come from the Clerk, the design is reasonable. In the unlikely event that the system should malfunction, however, it should be reasonably easy to see where things have gone wrong by insecting the slides and sections configurations text files and examinining the file contents of the Entries folder.
