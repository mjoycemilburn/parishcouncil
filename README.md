The  UK Government's Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 introduced a requirement for Parish Councils(PCs)  to pubish the data and information specified in the Code  on a
website which is publicly accessible free of charge. 

Many councils rose enthusiastically to the challenge of advertising their community and, consequently, a rich assembly of websites soon appeared.

Sadly, however, enthusiasm has generally since waned considerably. For one thing, while developing a website is fun, maintaining it subsequently is a chore. In the case of Parish COunci sites, new information arises in a continuous stream and, once the original site developers have moved on to fresh, more exciting challenges, the job of maintenance falls to individuals with less interest in technical matters and fewer skills.

Meanwhile, the range and depth of skill required to deliver a professional website have broadened and deepened. For one thing whereas in the past it would have been sufficient to produce a site that looked good on a desktop computer, one now needs to cater for smaller-screen devices such as Apple iphones. On the other hand, the range of government requirement has steadily widened. The latest iteration has introduceed a requirement for websites to be "accessible" in the sense that they are usable by individuals with limb and eyesight disaiities. These are worthy aspirations but potentially carry significant implication for PC budgets since it is likely that many Parish Councils will decide to sub-contract the job to commercial third parties.

This writers view is that present problems are largely a result of Parish COuncil's initial enthusiasm. The job required by Government was quite simple but Parish Council sites go far beyond the original brief in a worthy but thankless attempt to advertise their community. There are other places to do this and, significantly places are not subject to legal regulation. It would have been much better if Government had backed up the 2014 Act with a national website iton which councils could submit the mandatory information.

Ah well. The purpose of this site is to distribute, free of charge, a framework of code which can be used to create and maintain a Parish Council website to deliver Government requirement with a minimum of cost and effort.

A sample website produced by the framework is viewable at ???? As you'll see the style is austere but effective. There is enough personalisation to convey the character of the Coucil's community but the main thrust of the site is to present a clear and simple mechanism of accessing the legally-required information. The ste is basically just a curated list of links to rerence documents (pdf files) containing the detailed information. Configuration and maintenance of the site - ie the creationand maintenance f the site framework and the upload of the rerenced files - is delivered by a comprehensive site-update facility. The operator requires little more skill than the abiity to produce word-process douments and to turn these into pdf files. 

Meanwhile, the site generated by the update facility meets all Goveernment requirements and works well both large and small-screen device and most web-browser platforms.

The technical platform is Javascript and PHP with an emphasis on simplicity of technical design. Detailed instructions for installation and operation are included in the download package.
