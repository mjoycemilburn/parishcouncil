The  UK Government's Local Audit and Accountability Act 2014 requires Parish Councils (PCs) to publish their operations on a website. Many councils rose enthusiastically to the challenge and a rich assembly of websites quickly appeared.

Sadly, however, enthusiasm has generally waned considerably since. 

For one thing, while developing a website is fun, maintaining it subsequently is a chore. In the case of Parish Council sites, new information arises in a continuous stream and, once the original site developers have moved on to fresh, more exciting projects, the job of maintenance falls to individuals with less interest in technical matters and fewer skills.

Meanwhile, the range and depth of skill required to deliver a professional website has broadened and deepened. For one thing, whereas in the past it would have been sufficient to produce a site that looked good on a desktop computer, one now needs to cater for smaller-screen devices such as Apple iphones. At the same time, the range of government requirement has steadily widened. The latest iteration has introduced a demand for "accessibility". Websites are now required to be usable by individuals with limb and eyesight disaiities. These are worthy aspirations but expensive to deliver since the technology to implement a fully accessible site is quite demanding. It is likely that many Parish Councils will opt to sub-contract the work to commercial third parties, with conequenta financial implications.

This writers view is that the present problems are in large part due to Parish COuncil's initial enthusiasm. The job required by Government was quite simple, but most Parish Council sites go far beyond the original brief. There are other places to do this and, significantly, places that are not subject to legal regulation. 

Ah well. If the reader represents a Parish Council which either still has to create a website or is in possession of a complex website that is now becoming a burden, this site may be of interest since it provides, free of charge, a framework of code that  can be used to create  a Parish Council website stripped to the essentials. "Accessibiity" is built-in and templates are provided for some of the essential documents that the website must carry. A configuration and maintenance faciity is included to permit the site to be "personalised" to a limited extent while ensuring that routine updates are delivered with an absolute minium of effort.

An example of an operational website produced by an early version of the framework is viewable at https://milburnparishcouncil.co.uk/. As you'll see the style is austere but effective. There is a degree of "personalisation" available through the opening carousel to convey the character of the Council's community but the site concentrates on providing a clear and simple mechanism for accessing the legally-required information. The ste is basically just a curated list of links to reference documents (pdf files). Configuration and maintenance of the site - ie the creation and maintenance of the site framework and the upload of the rerenced files - is delivered by thr site-update facility. Operation of the system thus require requires little more skill than the abiity to produce word-process douments and to turn these into pdf files. 

Meanwhile, the site meets requirements for "accessibillity" and works well both large and small-screen device on all modern web-browser platforms.
