## Step 1

If you don't already have an account with an Internet Service Provider (ISP), the first thing you need to do is to open one. There are many to choose from. Hostpapa would be a typical choice. Take particular care when opening the account to ensure that the contact email address you register is one that will ensure continuity. ISP accounts are usually renewable annually and if you don't pay on time your website will disappear! You need to ensure that reminder emails go somewhere where they will trigger a response. Part of the procedure for opening the ISP account will be the selection of a url (website address, eg "newbigginparishcouncil.co.uk") for your site, and once this has been fixed, you will be able to create email addresses for this url. A good practice would be to create a "clerk@newbigginparishcouncil.co.uk" address that the current clerk could then link to their personal email address. It's also worth noting that if you already have an ISP for a different url, you can usually save yourself some money by registering your new parish council url as an "additional url" on the existing site. 

All of the above may seem a little intimidating, but ISPs usually have "frequently asked questions" advice sheets and helpful chat lines to guide you through the procedures.

## Step 2

You now need to upload the parishcouncil system software files into appropriate locations on your new server. The first step is to click the link advertising the latest release of parishcouncil at bottom-right on the Github page for parishcouncil. Then, if you're working on a PC, select the "Source code (zip)" link that appears and watch as the package is downloaded to your downloads folder. Once it's there, right-click the downloaded "parishcouncil_?.?.zip" file and select "extract all". You'll see a list of files and folder. The next task is to upload these to your ISP account. When you've finished, the content and structure of your website's public_html folder should match the content and structure of your downloaded parishcouncil release.

The procedure for uploading to a server varies from ISP to ISP. Commonly you use the credentials you will have been given for your account to log into a "Control Panel" and from there you can select a "File Manager" to organise your file storage. File Managers usually look a bit like Windows Explorer, and display a panel of folders to the left from which you can select a folder to have its file content displayed in a panel to the right. Files and Folders that are to be made accessible to the public are stored within a pre-defined "public_html" folder on the server. So to upload the parishcouncil software you should first select public_html in the left-hand panel to reveal an empty (or nearly-empty - there are usually some pre-assigned logging files etc - in the right hand panel) and then click the page's "Upload" button. A popup window will now open asking you to specify the source of the upload files, and at this point, you can usually use "drag and drop" to upload a whole hierarchy of files and folders in a single operation. 

It may be however that your ISP doesn't allow you to upload folders. In this case, there are two options. Either you can create the empty folders explicitly (taking great care to spell them exactly as defined in the download package) and drag and drop their contents into each of them in turn, or you can use an ftp utility such as Filezilla to copy the whole set at one go. The latter would be the preferred approach for experienced users - but perhaps that's not you. However, with persistence and assistance from your ISP's help desk, I'm sure you'll get this sorted. You are now pretty much done, except for one slight wrinkle.

The parishcouncil system essentially has just two components, a website file called index.html and a system maintenance file called manager.html. Now that we've got these files uploaded, the system is almost live and you should find that if you enter your url (eg newbigginparishcouncil.co.uk) into a website browser, the default version described in the Operating Guide document at https://mjoycemilburn.github.io/parishcouncil/ will be displayed. This is because the default target for a url is always a file called index.html and we've just uploaded this. 

You'll note, however, that a canny member of the public could also type newbigginparishcouncil.co.uk/manager.html. Does this mean that a canny member of the public could then use the manager.html file (that you've also just uploaded) to begin defacing your website? Well no, because if you try this, you'll find that the system responds by asking for a password.

You may wonder where this password is defined - and the answer is "in the pc_credentials.php that you've just uploaded to public_html". You might then wonder if a sensitive file like that should be placed in a public folder, and the answer is "no, we need to move this into a secure location". 

The public_html folder is actually a sub-folder of a secure master folder for your ISP account called "root". This is where the login screen expects to find pc_credentials.php. What you now need to do is first edit its contents (the current password setting is "newbiggin") to whatever password you wish and then move the file into root. File Manager should provide a "Move" button to allow you to do this. If not, use File Manager to delete the credentials file from public_html, select the root folder and re-upload pc_credentials.php from the extracted zip folder on your PC into root. If you ever feel the need to change the password, you'll need to re-enter your ISP control panel and use File Manager to access and edit the pc_credentials file in root, changing "newbiggin", or whatever password you're replacing, to the new value. 

Once you've done all this, however, your system is now secure and you can test that everything is working as intended by running the manager.html file (typically by entering newbigginparishcouncil.com/manager.html into the browser).
